# 02 Challenge Portfolio Website

## Purpose
The purpose of this site is to be a portfolio for me to display my work onto. This contains links to my work related socials as well as links to my email. 

## Function 

### Header
The site starts with a header containing my last name as well as a few links to different resources on the page. Each link when hovered on has an animation effect. When a link is clicked on it will direct the user to the related resource. 

### About me
This section has a header on the left side of the page and contains a little blurb about me.

### Work 
This section contains pictures of my work. My main work is larger than the other smaller displayed works. When hovering over it the picture becomes colourful as the default for the images has them greyed out. When you click on the box it takes you to the associated webpage. 

### Contact me
This section contains links to my work related socials. My LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram have been linked down here for anyone to view.
